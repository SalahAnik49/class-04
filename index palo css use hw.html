        <p align="left">Researchers found ‘AI (particularly large language models, or LLMs) may alter the nature of their work.
            The study was published in Journal, ‘Science.’ Grossmann and colleagues observed that large language
            models trained on massive amounts of text data are becoming more capable of simulating human-like responses
            and behaviour. This opens up new avenues for testing theories and hypotheses about human behaviour at
            unprecedented scale and speed. “What we wanted to explore in this article is how social science research
            practices can be adapted, even reinvented, to harness the power of AI,” said Igor Grossmann, professor of psychology
            at Waterloo. Traditionally, social sciences rely on a range of methods, including questionnaires, behavioural tests,
            observational studies, and experiments. A common goal in social science research is to obtain a generalised representation
            of the characteristics of individuals, groups, cultures, and their dynamics. With the advent of advanced AI systems,
            the landscape of data collection in social sciences may shift.</p>
            <br>
            <p align="center">“AI models can represent a vast array of human experiences and perspectives, possibly giving them a higher degree
                of freedom to generate diverse responses than conventional human participant methods, which can help to reduce
                generalisability concerns in research,” said Grossmann.</p>
